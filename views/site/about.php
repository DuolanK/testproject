    <h1>Welcome to my corner of the digital world!</h1>
        <p>
            I'm <strong>Duolan Kharitonov</strong>, a passionate and versatile Fullstack Developer with a rich background in both web development and law. With a unique blend of technical expertise and legal insight, I bring a holistic approach to creating innovative and reliable web solutions.
        </p>

        <h2>My Technical Journey</h2>
        <p>
            My primary focus lies in developing dynamic and robust websites using <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>. These powerful languages allow me to build everything from simple static pages to complex, data-driven web applications. Over the years, I've honed my skills and gained extensive experience in:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Backend Development</strong>: Crafting efficient and scalable server-side logic.</li>
            <li><strong>Frontend Development</strong>: Designing interactive and user-friendly interfaces.</li>
            <li><strong>Database Management</strong>: Utilizing <strong>MySQL</strong> and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> for optimal data storage and retrieval.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I also have a working knowledge of <strong>C#</strong> and <strong>Flutter</strong>, which enables me to extend my development capabilities into mobile app development and other areas requiring these languages.
        </p>

        <h2>Microservices and MVP Expertise</h2>
        <p>
            In today's fast-paced digital landscape, adaptability and scalability are key. I specialize in developing <strong>microservice applications</strong>, which allow for greater flexibility, easier maintenance, and seamless scaling. My approach ensures that each component of an application can be independently developed, deployed, and scaled.
        </p>
        <p>
            Creating a <strong>Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</strong> is another area where I excel. I understand the importance of rapidly bringing a product to market to test assumptions and gather user feedback. By focusing on the core functionalities and iterating based on real user input, I help businesses launch effective and user-centric products.
        </p>

        <h2>A Legal Perspective</h2>
        <p>
            In addition to my technical skills, I hold a degree in law. This unique combination of legal knowledge and technical expertise enables me to navigate the complex regulatory landscape that often surrounds tech projects. Whether itâ€™s ensuring compliance with data protection laws, drafting clear and fair terms of service, or understanding the legal implications of software development, my legal background provides an invaluable layer of insight and security.
